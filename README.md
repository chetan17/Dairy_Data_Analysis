# Dairy_Data_Analysis

This repository contains an assignment on Dairy Data Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The notebook explores and analyzes dairy-related data, applying various statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Files in this Repository

    Dairy_Data_Exploration.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.

    README.md - This file, describing the project and how to use it.

# Installation & Setup

 ## 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dairy_Data_Analysis.git
    cd Dairy_Data_Analysis

 ## 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\\Scripts\\activate'

 ## 3. Install Dependencies

    The required Python libraries are already imported within the Jupyter Notebook. However, to ensure you have the necessary dependencies, install the following commonly used packages:

      pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras opendatasets

 ## 4. Open Jupyter Notebook

    jupyter notebook

 ## 5 Then, open Dairy_Data_Exploration.ipynb and run the cells.

# Dataset

  The dataset is either a local file or downloaded using opendatasets. Check the notebook to determine how it is being loaded:

  If the dataset is expected to be local, ensure dairy_dataset.csv is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

  If the dataset is being downloaded via Kaggle, install opendatasets and follow the notebook instructions:

    pip install opendatasets


Follow the instructions in the python notebook file to download the dataset from Kaggle.
