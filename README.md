# 3 Installation & Setup

 ## i) Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dairy_Data_Analysis.git
    cd Dairy_Data_Analysis

 ## ii) Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\\Scripts\\activate'

 ## iii) Install Dependencies

    The required Python libraries are already imported within the Jupyter Notebook. 

 ##  iv) Open Jupyter Notebook

    jupyter notebook

 ##  v) Upload Dairy_Data_Exploration.ipynb and run the cells.

# 4 Dataset

  The dataset is either a local file or downloaded using opendatasets. Check the notebook to determine how it is being loaded:

  If the dataset is expected to be local, ensure dairy_dataset.csv is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

  If the dataset is being downloaded via Kaggle, install opendatasets and follow the notebook instructions:

    pip install opendatasets


Follow the instructions in the python notebook file to download the dataset from Kaggle.
