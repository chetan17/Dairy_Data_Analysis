   requirements.txt - List of dependencies required to run the notebook.

    README.md - This file, describing the project and how to use it.

# Installation & Setup

 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dairy_Data_Analysis.git
    cd Dairy_Data_Analysis

 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\\Scripts\\activate'

 3. Install Dependencies

    The required Python libraries are already imported within the Jupyter Notebook. However, to ensure you have the necessary dependencies, install the following commonly used packages:

      pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras opendatasets

 5. Open Jupyter Notebook

    jupyter notebook

  Then, open Dairy_Data_Exploration.ipynb and run the cells.

# Dataset

The dataset is required for the analysis. It can be sourced in the following ways:

Local File: Ensure dairy_dataset.csv is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

Kaggle Dataset: The notebook may use opendatasets to download data. If required, install it using:

pip install opendatasets

Follow the instructions in the notebook to download the dataset from Kaggle.

# Dependencies

The required Python libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Install them using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Contribution

Feel free to fork this repository and improve the analysis.
